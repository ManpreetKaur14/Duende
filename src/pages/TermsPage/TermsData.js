      "The remittance feature is designed to send cryptocurrencies to your acquaintances. You may send and receive remittances on the Duende Services for free. You may also send and receive remittances to or from outside the Duende Services, and we do not charge any fees on them either. However, there may be a fee that naturally occurred due to the architecture of the cryptocurrency. We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of cryptocurrencies you can send. The remittance feature cannot be used for the sale of goods or services, nor accepting donations. In these cases, you must use the payment feature of our Services.",

      "The payment feature is designed to handle cryptocurrency payments for the sale of goods or services and accepting donations. To accept payments, you have to create a business Duende account. When you accept payments, a certain percentage of the total payment amount will be charged as a fee. A fee may change from time to time. Please refer to FAQ to check the real-time fee. We do not charge any fees for Duende users who make payments. Only business Duende account users who accept payments are charged the fee. You must use the payment feature, not the remittance feature, for the sale of goods or services, and accepting donations.",

Duende determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for our Customer Protection Policy. You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim. The Customer Protection Policy may apply if you did not receive your item from a seller, or you received an item, but the item is not what you ordered.
